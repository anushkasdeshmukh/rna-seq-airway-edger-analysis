# RNA-seq Differential Expression with edgeR (Airway Dataset)

This repository contains an RNA-seq differential expression analysis using the real-world **airway** dataset, where human airway smooth muscle cells were treated with dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid). The analysis was performed using the **edgeR** package and visualized using **ggplot2** in R.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset is included in the Bioconductor `airway` package and originates from:

> Himes et al. *"RNA-seq transcriptome profiling identifies CRISPLD2 as a glucocorticoid responsive gene in airway smooth muscle cells."*  
> *Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol* (2014)

## 🧰 Tools & Packages Used
